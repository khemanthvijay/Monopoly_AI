# Monopoly AI  

## üìò Project Overview  
This project extends the **Monopoly Multiplayer** game by integrating an AI player built using **Deep Q-Networks (DQN)**. The AI is designed to make optimal decisions during gameplay, achieving an impressive **97% accuracy** and a **90% win rate** in simulated matches.  

Future work includes implementing advanced reinforcement learning techniques like **Actor-Critic** and **Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning (HRL)** to enable multi-decision tasks such as property trading and mortgaging.  

## üîß Technologies Used  
- **Reinforcement Learning**:  
  - **Deep Q-Networks (DQN)** for intelligent decision-making  
  - Exploring **Actor-Critic** and **Hierarchical RL (HRL)** methods for advanced gameplay strategies  
- **Server and Game Framework**:  
  - Built on the **Monopoly Multiplayer** framework using Node.js, WebSockets, and advanced JavaScript  

## üöÄ Key Features  
- **Intelligent AI Player**:  
  - Uses DQN to analyze the game state and make strategic decisions.  
  - Achieves 97% accuracy and dominates gameplay with a 90% win rate.  

- **Enhanced Gameplay**:  
  - AI integration offers players a competitive opponent, enriching the multiplayer experience.  
  - Supports decision-making in real-time, adapting to dynamic game scenarios.  

- **Modular Design**:  
  - Built on a scalable framework that supports adding more complex AI models.  
  - Allows easy integration of advanced RL techniques for future improvements.  

## üß† How the AI Works  
- **Deep Q-Networks (DQN)**:  
  - Trains on game scenarios to learn optimal policies for property management, rent collection, and strategic purchases.  
  - Balances immediate rewards with long-term strategies for a high win rate.  

- **Future Research and Development**:  
  - **Actor-Critic Methods**: Optimize policy gradients for improved decision-making.  
  - **Hierarchical RL**: Enable the AI to handle complex multi-decision tasks like trading and mortgaging properties.
